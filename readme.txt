An board game with procedurally generated effects and board shapes. This is my second project
that i made in may 2019 after 2D Tilegame. Here i focused on big app structure and
design patterns. Project took me about 50h. More info in readme.

Rules: each player moves a random number of 
fields according to their maximum and minimum speed. 
On most fields, you can choose one of the randomly generated effects. 
Chosen effect weakens and the rest strengthen so the effects are always trying to balance themselves.
For each lap, you get coins, which ultimately decide who will win the game.

Despite the fact that the game works in the console it is a much more extensive
project than the previous one. I focused on using a lot of design patterns 
and practicing good programming rules from the ClearCode book.
In addition, the great challenge was to add procedurally generated events - 
each element of them is random.

Design patterns used:
Strategy, facade, template method, null object, singleton and mediator

Also i have learned how to draw UML Class diagrams
